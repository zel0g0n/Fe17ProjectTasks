                    Are these the best cars to appear in the Fast and Furious franchise? We reckon so…

                    The Fast and Furious franchise has been one of the most successful series of films ever to grace cinema screens, having generated around $6 billion in ticket sales since the first instalment was released in 2001.

                    With the ninth and most recent film – F9 – hitting cinemas in 2021 after a series of Covid-19-related delays, the 10th movie – Fast X – is in production, while a further as-yet-untitled sequel is already in development.

                    The F&F franchise was fundamental in accelerating the careers of both Vin Diesel and the late Paul Walker, but the cars have always been at least as big a draw as the actors. Here we detail 10 of our favourite vehicles in a highly (un)scientific analysis.
